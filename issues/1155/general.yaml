                  ITU-T Study Group 2, which is the leading study group on
                  numbering, naming, addressing, identification and routing,
                  agreed at its meeting of 4 to 13 July 2018 to publish the
                  following statement in ITU Operational Bulletin:

                  Several number ranges under non geographic country codes are
                  used for eCall, the pan European emergency system for
                  vehicles. These numbers have been assigned by the ITU and they
                  have been available for use in association with eCall service.

                  These numbers are used as calling party numbers when the
                  device automatically calls the emergency number in the event
                  of an accident. They generally use 15 digit formats. From 31
                  March 2018, all new type cars sold in Europe must have eCall
                  capability.

                  In order for the eCall system to operate properly and for the
                  emergency services (e.g. call centres and intervention teams)
                  to dial back the phone numbers used by the eCall systems, it
                  is crucial that the eCall ranges be opened in all networks and
                  that the CLI (Calling Line Identification) for these calls is
                  passed between operators in a correct and diallable format
                  according to the relevant ITU recommendations.

                  Given the criticality of the service, we want to alert the
                  assignees and all stakeholders on the need for these numbers
                  to be opened and routed on public networks and in particular
                  those in Europe.
