                          The Basic Technical Numbering Plan (“Numbering Plan”)
                          was published in the Official Gazette of the
                          Federation on 21 June 1996. It lays the foundation for
                          proper administration and use of national numbering in
                          that it allocates the available resources efficiently,
                          fairly, equitably and in a non-discriminatory fashion.
                          Its adoption enabled the country to increase its
                          numbering resources, re-organize existing allocations,
                          harmonize the criteria for allocating long-distance
                          codes and comply with the relevant international
                          recommendations.

                          the Federal Institute of Telecommunications issuing
                          number portability rules and modifying the Basic

                          On 11 May 2018, the Official Gazette of the Federation
                          published the Agreement of the Plenum of the Federal
                          Institute of Telecommunications approving and issuing
                          the Basic Technical Numbering Plan, the Basic

                          2014. These new plans will enter into force on 3
                          August 2019.

                          In particular, the new Numbering Plan envisages
                          replacing the concepts of local and geographic numbers
                          with that of national numbers; eliminates the concept
                          of regional codes to delimit geographic areas for the
                          purposes of number assignment and use, adopting in
                          their stead a geographic division of 8 (eight) areas;
                          establishes the need to accredit 85 per cent (eighty
                          five per cent) usage of numbers previously assigned to
                          a specific mode of use and inside one area in order to
                          allocate additional numbering resources to
                          telecommunication service providers (“Providers”).

                          Additionally, it establishes electronic procedures for
                          the handling and management of procedures related to
                          numbering resources and clear, detailed and concise
                          assessment criteria for their sources; eliminates
                          long-distance originating operator identification
                          codes (ABC) and maintains the assignments of
                          long-distance destination operator identification
                          codes (BCD) — however, these will be used as
                          identification codes for the local originating and
                          destination network (IDO/IDD); requires all fixed
                          and/or mobile service providers to have an
                          administrative identification code (IDA); and
                          incorporates the mobile network code (MNC) assignment
                          procedure.

                          whether for fixed-line or mobile calls; eliminates the
                          prefixes: 01, 02, 044 and 045; eliminates the prefix 1
                          in dialling procedures for incoming international
                          calls to mobile numbers in the “calling party pays”
                          mode; and eliminates groups of special service codes

                          For the purposes of number assignment and
                          administration, the national territory is divided into
                          eight areas. Thus, all national numbers beginning with
                          the same digit belong to the same area.
