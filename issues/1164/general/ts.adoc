==== Zimbabwe (country code +263)

===== Communication of 12.XII.2018

The _Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ)_, Harare,
announces updates to the national numbering plan of Zimbabwe.

POTRAZ has approved the amendment and consolidation of National Geographical Area Codes
on the Public Switched Telephone Network in Zimbabwe by TelOne (Pvt) Limited.

POTRAZ has also assigned new subscriber number block of 078 6 XXX XXX and 078 7 XXX XXX
to Econet Wireless Zimbabwe.

The updated national numbering plan of Zimbabwe is as follows.

====== 1. Definitions

*Country Code (CC)*

Country Code (CC) is a digit or a combination of digits (one, two or three) identifying a specific country or countries.

*Dialling Plan*

A string or combination of decimal digits, symbols, that defines the method by which the numbering plan is used. +
 A dialling plan includes the use of prefixes, suffixes, and additional information, supplementary to the numbering plan, required to complete the call.

*Geographic Area Code or Area Code (AC)*

This refers to an area code that has a defined geographic boundary. Geographic area codes are for conventional fixed-line (or land line) services terminating at fixed points.

The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is divided into several geographic areas. Each of the geographic area is allocated an area code.

*International Access Prefix (IAP)*

A digit or combination of digits used to indicate that the number following is an international directory number. +
 In Zimbabwe the International Dialling Access Prefix is '00'.

*National Access Prefix (NAP) or Trunk Prefix*

A digit or combination of digits used by a calling subscriber to make a call to another subscriber in his own country, but outside his own numbering area or network. It provides access to the automatic outgoing trunk equipment.

In Zimbabwe, the digit zero ('0') is used as the National Access Prefix, indicating a call to another Geographic Area (fixed network) or a call from fixed to mobile network, mobile to mobile and any other network to VoIP network.

*National Destination Code (NDC)*

The NDC is a combination of digits identifying a different specific geographical area within a country or a different network or service group (Mobile or VoIP services).

*Subscriber Number (SN)*

The portion of the international E.164-number that identifies the subscriber in a network or numbering area is called the Subscriber Number (SN).

*X* – The notation used in this plan to represent any digit from 0 to 9

====== 2. Structure of the international E.164-number

The international E.164-number for geographic areas is composed of a variable number of decimal digits arranged in specific code fields. The international E.164-number code fields are the Country Code (CC) and the National Significant Number (NSN). National Significant Number (NSN) is the combination of the NDC and the SN.

|===
h| Country Code(CC) a| National Destination Code (NDC) or Area Code (AC) h| Subscriber Number (SN)
| 1-3 Digits(n) 2+| National (Significant) Number N(S)N +
Maximum (15-n) Digits
3+| International E.164 Number for Geographic Areas +
Maximum 15 Digits

|===

====== 3. Dialling Plan

*Local Dialling (PSTN)*

A subscriber in the same geographic area dials the Subscriber Number (SN) only.

|===
| Dialled digits for local PSTN call | SN (XXXXXXXX)
|===

*National Dialling*

A subscriber dialling a number in a geographical area that is outside own geographic area dials National Access Prefix, Area Code plus the subscriber number. A call from fixed to mobile, mobile to mobile or from any network to VoIP network within Zimbabwe is considered national.

|===
| Dialled digits for National Call (PSTN) | NAP + AC + SN
| Other Networks (MOBILE/VoIP) | NAP + NDC + SN
|===

*International Dialling*

A subscriber dialling an international number dials the International Access Prefix,
country Code, Area Code/Network Destination Code plus the subscriber number.

The plus sign (+) can be used to indicate an international access prefix.
(e.g. +263 for Zimbabwe).

|===
| Dialled digits (PSTN) | IAP + CC + AC + SN
| Other Networks (MOBILE/VoIP) | IAP + CC + NDC + SN
