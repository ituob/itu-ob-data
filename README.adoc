= ITU Operational Bulletin Data

The data here is used in building ituob.org site, as we well as PDF & HTML deliverables (work in progress).

== General

Provides a formalized representation of OB and associated ITU publications.

== Modifying data

The link:https://github.com/ituob/itu-ob-editor/[ITU OB editor] app,
currently in early alpha testing mode,
will be the primary tool for modifying this data.

The app will enable ITU OB authors to create & edit bulletin editions
through graphical user interface, and push the changes to the repository
(subsequently triggering ituob.org CI build).

== Vocabulary

List::
a dataset maintained by ITU in connection with a certain Recommendation.

List position::
a snapshot of that dataset deemed as valid at given point in time.
+
From time to time (could be every few years), a new snapshot of a List is created.
+
This happens around planned publication date of next OB issue, and that issue
is then published with dataset snapshot (List position) annexed to it.
+
Subsequent OB issues may disseminate amendments to that dataset,
until a new snapshot is published.

Lists annexed::
see "`Running annexes`".

Running annexes::
effective datasets (Lists) or their latest snapshots (List positions)
disseminated by ITU at given point in time.
+
A list of running annexes at the time of each OB issue’s publication date
is provided in the beginning of that issue under "`Lists annexed`" section.
A list of current annexes as of latest issue is provided
on ITU site under ITU-T publications section.

ITU OB::
ITU Operational Bulletin.

Message::
a piece of information disseminated via ITU OB.
Maps to a section within an OB issue.
+
Usually a message is connected to an ITU recommendation.
+
A message may be an amendment, or otherwise be a notice of general kind.
+
(The system that reads this dataset fills out, partially or fully,
message contents based on message type, user input,
linked data and OB issues.)

Amendment::
an update to a service publication
(a List position annexed to a previous OB issue, or an external publication).
+
Always specifies the target being amended.

Amendment target::
references the original publication being amended.
+
Must specify `publication` (specifying original publication)
and, where applicable, `position_on` (specifying the version/issue/snapshot).

External publication::
ITU publication not annexed to a previous OB issue,
such as List V, List VIII or NNP / Telephone Service dataset.

== Message types

See: https://github.com/ituob/ituob.org/blob/master/_config.yml#L10 (https://github.com/ituob/ituob.org/issues/6)

Following message types currently are implemented:

* `running_annexes`
* `approved_recommendations`
* `service_restrictions`
* `callback_procedures`
* `telephone_service`
* `org_changes`
* `misc_communications`
* `iptn`
* `mid`
* `sanc`
* `amendment`

Most message types specify freeform contents using `contents: <relative path to .adoc file>` key.

Certain message types require messages to specify particular set of keys.

== Localized contents

Data that supports multiple languages is specified in the following format:

[source,yaml]
--
some_translatable_field:
  en: Hello
  ja: こんにちは
--

In above example localizable values are strings, but they can also be
objects (in case of formatted freeform contents output, ProseMirror-style):


[source,yaml]
--
some_translatable_contents:
  en:
    type: doc
    content:
      - type: paragraph
        content:
          - type: text
            text: Hello        
  ja:
    type: doc
    content:
      - type: paragraph
        content:
          - type: text
            text: こんにちは
--

Translatable string values may also contain relative paths to .adoc files,
in cases with localizable freeform message contents.
