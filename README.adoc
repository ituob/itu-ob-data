Provides a formalized representation of OB and associated ITU publications.

= Vocabulary

List::
a dataset maintained by ITU in connection with a certain Recommendation.

List position::
a snapshot of that dataset deemed as valid at given point in time.
+
From time to time (could be every few years), a new snapshot of a List is created.
+
This happens around planned publication date of next OB issue, and that issue
is then published with dataset snapshot (List position) annexed to it.
+
Subsequent OB issues may disseminate amendments to that dataset,
until a new snapshot is published.

Lists annexed::
see “Running annexes”.

Running annexes::
effective datasets (Lists) or their latest snapshots (List positions)
disseminated by ITU at given point in time.
+
A list of running annexes at the time of each OB issue’s publication date
is provided in the beginning of that issue under “Lists annexed” section.
A list of current annexes as of latest issue is provided
on ITU site under ITU-T publications section.

ITU OB::
ITU Operational Bulletin.

Message::
a piece of information disseminated via ITU OB.
Maps to a section within an OB issue.
+
Usually a message is connected to an ITU recommendation.

A message may be an amendment, or otherwise be a notice of general kind.

Amendment::
an update to a service publication
(a List position annexed to a previous OB issue, or an external publication).
+
Always specifies the target being amended.
  
Amendment target::

Must specify _publication_ (specifying original publication)
and _position_on_ (specifying the version/issue/snapshot).

External publication::

such as List V, List VIII or NNP / Telephone Service dataset.

= Message types

Following message types currently are implemented:

* running_annexes
* approved_recommendations
* service_restrictions
* iptn
* telephone_service
* amendment

For now, most message types specify freeform contents
using `contents: <AsciiDoc file path>` key.
